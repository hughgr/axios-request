axios-request
======

in general axios-request is just a http request instance above [axios](https://github.com/mzabriskie/axios) library

two things you need to notice

### factory
with factory function you can fully create http instance using all axios api 


### normalRequest
pre-configured http instance created by factory method


### one more thing
I add some useful functions such as cacheGet,strongCacheGet & etc.

read the code, find the bug, thanks.
